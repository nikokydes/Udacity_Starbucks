# Starbucks Reward Program Project

## Project Description
This is a capstone project project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program. Starbucks has a reward program which sends special offers to registered customers not available to general public. For this project, we will be analyzing a simulated data set of offer specifications and customer behavior over time to gain insight on which customer and offer attributes drive offer success. The purpose of this project is to determine which customer segments respond best to each type of offer. To do this, classifications model are used which determine the probability of success for a given offer and customer.

## Installation
This application was created using a standard Anaconda Python installation with a core python version of 3.6.3.  Libraries used include:
- _Scikit-Learn_ for machine learning
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## File Descriptions
The file structure of the repository is as follows:

- The **Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb** file is the main Jupyter Notebook file where all analysis is done
- The files in the **/data/** directory contain the offer, customer, and tranaction data used for the analysis
   - **portfolio.json** contains the attributes of the 10 offers sent to customers
   - **profile.json** contains the customer demographic information for 17,000 customers
   - **transcript.json** contains the transaction history for 306,534 transactions
- The **/images/** directory contains the images used to create the project report
